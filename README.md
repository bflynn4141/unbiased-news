# Unbiased News

Aggregate news from multiple sources to present unbiased reporting.

## Vision

In an era of increasingly polarized media, **Unbiased News** aims to aggregate stories from diverse news sources, identify potential biases, and present readers with a more complete picture of current events.

The goal is not to tell you what to think, but to show you the full spectrum of how stories are being reported.

## Planned Features

- **Multi-source aggregation** - Pull articles from sources across the political spectrum
- **Bias detection** - Analyze language patterns and framing to identify potential bias
- **Side-by-side comparison** - View how different outlets cover the same story
- **CLI tool** - Quick access to aggregated news from your terminal
- **API** - Programmatic access for building your own applications
- **Topic clustering** - Group related stories across sources

## Tech Stack

*To be determined* - evaluating options including:
- TypeScript/Node.js for the core engine
- Python for ML-based bias detection
- Various news APIs and RSS feeds for data sources
